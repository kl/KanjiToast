KanjiToast
==========

KanjiToast listens to the clipboard and when it detects that a kanji has been copied to the clipboard it displays a Toast message with the English meaning of the kanji.

The English keywords that are used are from the Remembering the Kanji books by James W. Heisig. All kanji that are present in the books are included.

Usage
=====

Start the application and make sure that the kanji lookup service is started. Then go to any other application and copy a kanji to the clipboard.
